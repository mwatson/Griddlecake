Griddlecake
===========

A CSS grid system that's less dumb than other CSS grid systems (maybe)!

Pertinent Info
--------------

Grab one of the files in the css folder and either paste the contents into your
own CSS or use it on its own if you like.  Stick a line in there like so:

        .griddle { width: 960px; }
        
Where the width is the actual width of your site. Essentially the griddle
class is the one you want to control on your own. Griddlecake will just work
after that, as long as you love it.

You can find examples and use cases on the website:

Other Stuff
-----------

I've also included a small PHP class I wrote that will generate a Griddlecake
CSS for you on the fly. I would recommend just using a static file but if you
need to generate your own or something feel free to use it. Instructions on
how to use it are in the comments of the file. This class is provided 'as is'
with under the same license as Griddlecake itself (see below).

About
-----

Griddlecake was created by Mike Watson, who thinks CSS is pretty sweet. The
name 'Griddlecake' is partially a (weak) pun (because it has the word 'grid' in
it, get it) but mostly named after his dog, Pancake. Griddlecake is released
under the [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).
The current (and probably final) version is version 1.0.
